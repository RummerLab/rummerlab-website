  description: `In collaboration with the RummerLab and the Centre de Recherches Insulaires et Observatoire de l'Environnement (CRIOBE), 
  the Physioshark Project was conceived in 2013. We work on the Island of Moorea in French Polynesia where we have identified 
  11 potential shark nurseries. Here, mother sharks give birth to blacktip reef and sicklefin lemon sharks during the months 
  of October - February every year.`,
