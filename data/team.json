His research has focused on the ecology and conservation of marine predators, primarily sharks. He has been studying the behavioural, trophic, and movement ecology as well as and conservation biology of sharks using multiple advanced and non-invasive approaches including underwater observations, biologging, genetics, stable isotope analyses, and network theory. Most of his first studies, including his PhD research, were conducted in the remote and healthy coral reefs of French Polynesia (Pacific Ocean) on blacktip reef sharks. His research on juvenile reef sharks in Moorea served as a baseline for project PhysioShark. He is also involved in a citizen science program on elasmobranch (Shark Observatory of French Polynesia; ORP) since 2011. Dr Mourier has now published over 40 research papers in the field of behavioural ecology and shark science. These have generated nearly 1,000 citations (Google Scholar), and he has an overall H-Index of 18. This has established him as one of the leading early-career scientists in his field.",

Over the past 30 years, he has published about 250 papers in international journals addressing population genetics of coral reefs, ecology, marine protected areas, and recruitment of marine fishes. With about 14,000 citations, his work has been highly recognized while demonstrating that coral reef fish populations are much more limited in space than was generally believed and that self-recruitment is significant drive. This view has major implications for conservation planning.\n\nSuch international recognition led Dr Planes to being invited to participate as a member of the Australian Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, and he was recently appointed as adjunct professor at Australian Institute or Marine Science. After having coordinated several European projects, numerous national projects, and the last Tara Pacific expedition, Dr Planes is presently directing the LABEX \"CORAIL\" awarded in 2011 for 10 years and renewed in 2019 for another 5 years, this being the major structural framework for research on coral reef ecology in France.",

For his PhD, he investigated the capacity for juvenile blacktip (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and lemon sharks (N. acutidens) to balance processes related to energy expenditure and acquisition while managing stressors across a range of environmental conditions in nursery habitats around Moorea, French Polynesia. In addition to Dr. Rummer, he is supervised by Dr. Colin Simpfendorfer.\n\nIan completed his Ph.D. as a co-tutelle at the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies (James Cook University) and the Centre de Recherches Insulaires et Observatoire de l'Environnement (École Pratique des Hautes Études). He investigated the ecophysiology of global change for tropical sharks by testing hypotheses predicting species' vulnerability to global change phenomena, including ocean warming, acidification, and deoxygenation.\n\nIan has been involved in shark research since 2008. For his research, Ian utilises a range of techniques belonging to the \"Conservation Physiology Toolbox\" including respirometry and bio-logging. Before joining Physioshark in 2016, Ian's previous research focused on understanding the energetic costs, physiological stress, and behavioural responses of sharks to longline capture, including the implementation of bycatch devices.",

    "description": "Ornella is a Swiss marine biologist that has been studying shark ecology for the past eleven years. She is particularly interested in the behavioural and trophic ecology of sharks, as well as the conservation of coastal juvenile shark populations. Ornella is experienced in using various non-invasive methods such as stable isotope analyses, DNA barcoding, catch and release practices, and underwater observations.\n\nOrnella first got involved into marine science during her internship at the renowned <a href=\"https://www.biminisharklab.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">Bimini Biological Field Station</a> (BBFS) in 2009. Fascinated by this experience, she returned to the station in early 2011 to investigate the diet of juvenile lemon sharks for her Master thesis. Following multiple jobs as a research assistant in the US, Seychelles, and French Polynesia, Ornella started her PhD at the French University EPHE in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://saveourseas.com/sosf-darros-research-centre/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">Save Our Seas Foundation - D'Arros</a> Research Centre (SOSF - DRC), the <a href=\"http://www.criobe.pf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">CRIOBE</a> and the Physioshark research programme. As part of her PhD, Ornella investigated the coexistence of two juvenile reef shark species and the possible effects of competition on the species' ecological niches. After obtaining her Ph.D. in summer 2020, Ornella continues to investigate sharks' trophic ecology, as well as anthropogenic impacts on the ecology and physiology of sharks. In addition, Ornella raises awareness of sharks by sharing her knowledge through public presentations, media engagements, as a scientific expedition leader for the Sail and Explore Association, and as a mentor and consultant for undergrad students.

They have since been employed by CRIOBE in Moorea, French Polynesia as a research assistant (both field and laboratory) working on many subjects including: PCC (post-larvae capture and culture, catching fish by crest net and by light-trap), fish behaviour, coral larvae behaviour, annual monitoring of juveniles lemon and black tip reef shark populations, scientific diving to record lemon shark behaviour, annual monitoring of glass eel population, etc. They have also been working with Dr. Rummer on her ongoing project -- #physioshark -- as a field and laboratory assistant focusing on blood sampling and analyses.",

    "description": "Originally from Denmark where he earned his Bachelor's degree at Copenhagen University studying fish ecophysiology. He moved to Australia in 2005 where he earned his Master of Science (2007) and PhD (2013), both at James Cook University. He is interested in how commercially or ecologically important reef fishes tolerate adverse or extreme environmental conditions, and his specialities are whole organism performance metrics, e.g. energetics of swimming and behaviour. After finishing a post-doc at the University of Florida in the Whitney Lab, he is now based at the University of Texas at Austin working on oil spill impacts on commercially fished species.",

    "description": "Originally from Adelaide, South Australia, Giverny completed her BSc (Hons) at Flinders University. During her honours she worked on fisheries related projects and subsequently took on a position as a research assistant at the South Australian Research and Development Institute. In 2012 she moved to Townsville to start her PhD at James Cook University. This research concentrated on the effects of climate change relevant increases in temperature on coral reef fish from low-latitudes. She utilised a wide range of physiological measures including metabolic performance, enzyme activity, tissue histology and critical thermal limits to understand the potential for developmental and trans-generational acclimation of reef fish to environmental stressors. Outside of her research she is interested in science communication and outreach, volunteering for various programs teaching science primarily to indigenous students in remote communities. She is also a councillor for the Australian Coral Reef Society.",
