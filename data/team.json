His research has focused on the ecology and conservation of marine predators, primarily sharks. He has been studying the behavioural, trophic, and movement ecology as well as and conservation biology of sharks using multiple advanced and non-invasive approaches including underwater observations, biologging, genetics, stable isotope analyses, and network theory. Most of his first studies, including his PhD research, were conducted in the remote and healthy coral reefs of French Polynesia (Pacific Ocean) on blacktip reef sharks. His research on juvenile reef sharks in Moorea served as a baseline for project PhysioShark. He is also involved in a citizen science program on elasmobranch (Shark Observatory of French Polynesia; ORP) since 2011. Dr Mourier has now published over 40 research papers in the field of behavioural ecology and shark science. These have generated nearly 1,000 citations (Google Scholar), and he has an overall H-Index of 18. This has established him as one of the leading early-career scientists in his field.",

Over the past 30 years, he has published about 250 papers in international journals addressing population genetics of coral reefs, ecology, marine protected areas, and recruitment of marine fishes. With about 14,000 citations, his work has been highly recognized while demonstrating that coral reef fish populations are much more limited in space than was generally believed and that self-recruitment is significant drive. This view has major implications for conservation planning.\n\nSuch international recognition led Dr Planes to being invited to participate as a member of the Australian Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, and he was recently appointed as adjunct professor at Australian Institute or Marine Science. After having coordinated several European projects, numerous national projects, and the last Tara Pacific expedition, Dr Planes is presently directing the LABEX \"CORAIL\" awarded in 2011 for 10 years and renewed in 2019 for another 5 years, this being the major structural framework for research on coral reef ecology in France.",

For his PhD, he investigated the capacity for juvenile blacktip (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and lemon sharks (N. acutidens) to balance processes related to energy expenditure and acquisition while managing stressors across a range of environmental conditions in nursery habitats around Moorea, French Polynesia. In addition to Dr. Rummer, he is supervised by Dr. Colin Simpfendorfer.\n\nIan completed his Ph.D. as a co-tutelle at the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies (James Cook University) and the Centre de Recherches Insulaires et Observatoire de l'Environnement (École Pratique des Hautes Études). He investigated the ecophysiology of global change for tropical sharks by testing hypotheses predicting species' vulnerability to global change phenomena, including ocean warming, acidification, and deoxygenation.\n\nIan has been involved in shark research since 2008. For his research, Ian utilises a range of techniques belonging to the \"Conservation Physiology Toolbox\" including respirometry and bio-logging. Before joining Physioshark in 2016, Ian's previous research focused on understanding the energetic costs, physiological stress, and behavioural responses of sharks to longline capture, including the implementation of bycatch devices.",

    "description": "Ornella is a Swiss marine biologist that has been studying shark ecology for the past eleven years. She is particularly interested in the behavioural and trophic ecology of sharks, as well as the conservation of coastal juvenile shark populations. Ornella is experienced in using various non-invasive methods such as stable isotope analyses, DNA barcoding, catch and release practices, and underwater observations.\n\nOrnella first got involved into marine science during her internship at the renowned <a href=\"https://www.biminisharklab.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">Bimini Biological Field Station</a> (BBFS) in 2009. Fascinated by this experience, she returned to the station in early 2011 to investigate the diet of juvenile lemon sharks for her Master thesis. Following multiple jobs as a research assistant in the US, Seychelles, and French Polynesia, Ornella started her PhD at the French University EPHE in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://saveourseas.com/sosf-darros-research-centre/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">Save Our Seas Foundation - D'Arros</a> Research Centre (SOSF - DRC), the <a href=\"http://www.criobe.pf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800\">CRIOBE</a> and the Physioshark research programme. As part of her PhD, Ornella investigated the coexistence of two juvenile reef shark species and the possible effects of competition on the species' ecological niches. After obtaining her Ph.D. in summer 2020, Ornella continues to investigate sharks' trophic ecology, as well as anthropogenic impacts on the ecology and physiology of sharks. In addition, Ornella raises awareness of sharks by sharing her knowledge through public presentations, media engagements, as a scientific expedition leader for the Sail and Explore Association, and as a mentor and consultant for undergrad students.

They have since been employed by CRIOBE in Moorea, French Polynesia as a research assistant (both field and laboratory) working on many subjects including: PCC (post-larvae capture and culture, catching fish by crest net and by light-trap), fish behaviour, coral larvae behaviour, annual monitoring of juveniles lemon and black tip reef shark populations, scientific diving to record lemon shark behaviour, annual monitoring of glass eel population, etc. They have also been working with Dr. Rummer on her ongoing project -- #physioshark -- as a field and laboratory assistant focusing on blood sampling and analyses.",

The aim of his PhD research is to find reliable biomarkers for stress that can be applied in the wild to (1) identify which elasmobranch species are more vulnerable to human and environmental stressors, (2) which populations experience most human and environmental stressors, and (3) to quantify chronic stress experienced by captive sharks to inform best husbandry practices in zoos and aquaria.",

Isaac spent a little over a year as a volunteer in the RummerLab, assisting and learning from the Master's and PhD students and their projects. The projects focus on understanding the capacity for epaulette sharks in particular to physiologically adapt to environmental stressors to make contributions to conservation of aquatic ecosystems. In addition to assisting other researchers in the RummerLab, Isaac conducted his own research into the role of various environmental factors and physiological traits during captive adult epaulette shark oogenesis on the outcome of eggs produced. Additionally, he furthered previous studies into the biological and behavioural processes of the epaulette shark, exploring the role that the presence or absence of light plays during embryonic development. Isaac was one of 10 students that were granted a New Columbo Plan scholarship to join Dr Jodie Rummer in Mo'orea, French Polynesia for a shark conservation physiology field subject to become immersed in her Physioshark Project research programme and to learn from her extraordinary network of researchers, educators, and conservationists working on and alongside it.",

Initially started volunteering in Mo'orea, French Polynesia where I helped with field work every evening in catching, tagging and releasing juvenile/neonate Blacktip Reef Sharks and Sicklefin Lemon Sharks. Later when I commenced my degree at JCU I got involved with the Rummer/Physioshark Lab helping with husbandry, training new members, Port Douglas Field Research and various experiment of graduate students including blood sampling, kinematics studies, dissections, elasmobranch egg husbandry and assisting in shark surgery.

Her research investigates the energetic costs associated with digestion in neonate epaulette sharks (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), with a particular focus on the influence of temperature. She examines specific dynamic action (SDA) as a critical component of the neonatal energy budget, using intermittent flow respirometry to quantify oxygen uptake rates during ingestion, digestion and assimilation. Her study aims to elucidate the energetic demands of early growth, the energetic cost of the metabolic transition from endogenous yolk reserves to active foraging, and the potential constraints imposed by increased temperatures. By integrating physiological and ecological perspectives, her research contributes to a broader understanding of thermal tolerance in early life stages and the implications of climate change on developmental energetics in elasmobranchs.",
